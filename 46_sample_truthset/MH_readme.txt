# Covid test data release 2021-08-13

This archive contains two Covid data sets for testing purposes:

1. 16 samples sequenced at Oxford.
2. 30 Samples from the publication "Genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 during early
   introduction into the Baltimoreâ€“Washington metropolitan area",
   Thielen et al 2021.  https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.144350

All samples have ARTIC sequencing from both Illumina and ONT technologies.

The Oxford files are in the folder `Oxford/` and the Thielen et al files are
in the folder `Thielen`. The Thielen data has its own README, describing
how all the data were obtained and the sample IDs used.
The samples from Oxford are named using the MD5 sum of the FASTQ file
of the forward Illumina reads.

Within each folder there is:

1. A `Reads/` folder containing Illumina forwards and reverse FASTQ files and a
   single FASTQ file of ONT reads for each sample.
2. A `VCF_and_cons_seq` folder containing base-by-base manually-curated truth
   for these samples, in the following form. For each sample a VCF file of
   curated-truth variants and a FASTA file of the truth consensus sequence
   generated from that VCF file.

**It is important to note that the VCF and consensus FASTA files should be
considered a guide only. They are work in progress and subject to change**.
These files were generated by hand, manually inspecting the pileup of reads
against the reference genome.
We are confident in all records that have "PASS" in the filter column.
There are in total 19 and 4 VCF records across the Oxford and Thielen data
respectively that are not "PASS" records. We are confident in
all non-N bases, except for where amplicons have dropped out.

However, please aware of the following issues:

1. Amplicon failures have not been taken into account, for example we have
   not replaced the consensus with Ns at failures.
2. Heterozygous calls need formalising. You will see notes inside the VCF
   files of guesses as to the proportion of ref/alt read depths. In future,
   these will be replaced with accurate counts.
3. The start and end of the genome has not been inspected for where read
   coverage starts. Future consensus sequences are likely to have the
   starts and ends masked. For now, the unedited reference genome has been used.
4. The consensus files were generated by simply applying the variants from
   the VCF files. Anything other than a `PASS` variant has been replaced with
   an N in the consensus. Other ambiguous IUPAC codes have not been used,
   for example R to mean A or G.
5. In attempting to define the true underlying sequence, Illumina and ONT
   reads were required to agree to call a variant. Positions where they
   disagree were flagged as "unsure" in the VCF file, and replaced with
   Ns in the consensus FASTA.

All of the above 5 items are due to be addressed before these data are
finalised and accessioned/published.

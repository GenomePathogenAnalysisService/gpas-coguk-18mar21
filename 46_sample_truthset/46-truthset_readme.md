# 46 Sample Truth-Set Results

Within this directory are the results and outputs from a 46 sample truthset comprising of:
1. 16 samples sequenced at Oxford. These samples are named using the MD5 sum of the FASTQ file from the forward Illumina reads
 

2. 30 Samples from the publication "Genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 during early introduction into the Baltimoreâ€“Washington metropolitan area", Thielen et al 2021. https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.144350

All samples have ARTIC sequencing from both Illumina and ONT technologies.

These results were generated from running samples through different pipelines in GPAS/SP3 24/9/2021. The fastq's were processed through CATSUP with human read removal performed by Kraken. Of note this has now been replaced with a newer upload and human read removal client. 

For further information regarding the countenance of the samples in this truth-set see `MH_readme` and `Thielen_readme` written by Martin Hunt who curated the VCF files.
